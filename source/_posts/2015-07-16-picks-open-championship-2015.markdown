For this week, we chose Dustin Johnson as the player who will be among the Top5. 

Its history in this tournament shows, he likes to play here and will surely make a great game.


 
## RICKIE FOWLER - TOP 10   {% img right /images/rickie_fowler.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System'%}

The California player,likes to play at St Andrews, and he proved last year when he made a second place in this tournament.

We hope that Rickie make a great tournament and is a favorite to enter the top 10

 

## ADAM SCOTT - TOP 10   {% img right /images/adam_scott.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System'%}

Despite not getting very good positions in 2010 and 2011,in the last three years been in the top 5 in this tournament.

We hope to improve their performance last year and get a good position.
