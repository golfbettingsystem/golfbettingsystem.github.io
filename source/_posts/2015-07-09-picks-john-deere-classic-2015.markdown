In this post of picks, we describe the 4 players with the best possible option that maximize the return in John Deere Classic 2015.


## JORDAN SPIETH - TOP 5   {% img right /images/jordan_spieth.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System' 'An image of Jordan Spieth' %}

After the brilliant start of season of the new american pearl, this is a tournament that he has won previously (2013) and 7ยบ in 2014,
so we anticipate that this year can "catch" something big again.

According to statistics, we see that is a field that dominates, since between 2013 and 2014, he did 44 birdies, 46 pairs and has managed only 8 bogeys. 

This shows the strength of the player in this field.



## ZACH JONHSON - TOP 5   {% img right /images/zach_jonhson.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System' 'An image of Zach Jonhson' %}

The Iowa City player, has won a one victory in this tournament (2012), 3 seconds places (2009, 2013 and 2014) and a third in 2011. 

Note that Zach Johnson has only played around over par in last seven years in this event (it was in the third round of 2008 and made 75 strokes). 
Another important aspect is safety from the tee and the street, as it has not committed any penalty (penalty stroke or dropping) since 2008. 

To this should be added that it is the players who hit the ball longer, with an average of 300 yards off the tee. 
This coupled with 136 birdies and just 36 bogeys and 3 double bogeys makes it a strong candidate for the title


## STEVE STRICKER - TOP 10   {% img right /images/steve_stricker.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System' 'An image of Steve Stricker' %}

We could say that this tournament, is the quintessential tournament of Steve Stricker, because in the last five years has been achieved, 
no more no less than 3 consecutive victories between 2009-2011, also, in the years 2012-2014 has achieved three top 15 finishes, including a 5ยบ in 2012 and 3ยบ in 2013. 

As an additional point for Stricker note that in the period between 2009 and 2014 has never fallen 70% of greens in regulation
(we can deduce their safety in this field and the success with the irons of the player).

All this adds to trust this player to victory on Sunday.


## TIM CLARK - TOP 20   {% img right /images/tim_clark.png 130 172 'Golf Betting System' 'An image of Tim Clark' %}

For this week we have trust on Tim Clark, as in the previous four years he got a fifth in 2014 and seventh in 2012.
 
The South African player conveys confidence, in 2012 he got an averaged around 67 strokes (4 under par) and in 2013 66 (5 under par), 
this shows us that this field gives him the confidence to deploy their game, short distance but reliable from tee to green (average 80% of streets and 80% greens in regulation ).
